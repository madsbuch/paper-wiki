# Projects

Projects are bigger pieces of work that needs to be planned and done over multiples sessions.

Projects have

1. A planning phase
   1. What changes needs to be done
   2. How can these changes be broken down
   3. How can we ensure that future changes take these changes into account
2. An execution file that lists up tasks that each can be done as a part of a single session or less
3. Done criteria - when the project is done (acceptance requirements.)

## Project: Everything linked

Currently there are some issues. Papers ara not consistently back linked from concepts. Concepts also don't
link to projects and essays.

I want everything to be properly linked. Both in the database and also on pages, so that it is easier to navigate

## Project: Graph

I want to have a page where I can see all wiki entries, papers pages, authors, years, projects, and essays as a graph.
I want this so I want see how everything inter relates.
