      abstract="This chapter defends trope theory as the best account of properties. Tropes are particularized properties—individual ways that things can be—as opposed to universals, which are 'repeatable' entities that can be wholly present in diverse individuals. The chapter presents several arguments favoring trope theory over realism about universals: the particularity of causal relations (only particulars can participate in causal relationships), ontological parsimony (nominalism posits fewer basic types of entities), and the ability to avoid positing states of affairs as a separate ontological category. The chapter also defends trope theory against objections including concerns about brute resemblances, Bradley's regress, and the Armstrong-Hochberg objection that tropes play too many theoretical roles. The trope theory defended maintains a substance-attribute ontology rather than a bundle theory, and includes the thesis of nontransferability—that tropes belong necessarily to the individuals having them."

      impact="This work contributes to the ongoing debate in analytic metaphysics about the nature of properties. By defending a substance-attribute version of trope theory (as opposed to bundle theory), Jaworski provides a framework that combines the strengths of both nominalism (particularity of everything that exists) and realism (ontological seriousness about properties) while avoiding their respective weaknesses. The trope theory articulated here also provides the metaphysical foundation for Jaworski's hylomorphic approach to the mind-body problem developed in the larger work."
