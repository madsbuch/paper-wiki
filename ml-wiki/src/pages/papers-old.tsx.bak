      abstract: "We train GPT-3, a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, and test its in-context learning abilities. We evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets in zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP tasks without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, sometimes matching or exceeding state-of-the-art despite being evaluated without task-specific fine-tuning.",

      pdfPath: "/papers/1810.04805v2.pdf",
      abstract: "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.",

It demonstrated that a single pretrained model could be adapted to many tasks with minimal architecture changes, making NLP more accessible and practical."

      pdfPath: "/papers/2201.11903v6.pdf",
      abstract: "We explore how generating a chain of thought—a series of intermediate reasoning steps—significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain-of-thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.",

It has become a standard technique in prompt engineering."

      pdfPath: "/papers/2203.02155v1.pdf",
      abstract: "Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters.",
      keyContributions: [

      impact: "InstructGPT demonstrated that alignment through human feedback is more important than raw model scale. This work established RLHF as the standard approach for making language models helpful, honest, and harmless. It directly led to ChatGPT and influenced how modern AI systems are trained to follow user intentions safely and effectively."
