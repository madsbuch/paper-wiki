# The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Scale: When Bigger Actually Became Better

There's a moment in every scientific revolution when researchers realize they've been playing the wrong game. For decades, AI researchers crafted clever architectures, designed intricate training procedures, and engineered sophisticated features. Then someone asked a simpler question: what if we just made it bigger?

The answer changed everything.

## The Old Rules

In 2018, when BERT arrived on the scene, AI research still followed predictable patterns. You'd take a problem, design a solution, test it, and iterate. Bigger models helped, but with diminishing returns. The field operated under an assumption so obvious it rarely needed stating: intelligence comes from cleverness, not size.

BERT challenged this, but gently. It came in two sizes: BERT BASE with 110 million parameters, and BERT LARGE with 340 million [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 3]. The authors tested what happened when you scaled up. The results appeared in Table 6 of their paper—a modest table that hinted at something profound.

BERT LARGE consistently outperformed BERT BASE across every task. On MNLI, accuracy improved from 84.4% to 85.7%. On MRPC, from 86.7% to 86.9%. On SST-2, from 92.9% to 93.3% [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 9]. The gains seemed incremental, the kind you'd expect from more parameters.

But then came the really interesting part. The paper noted: "We can see that larger models lead to a strict accuracy improvement across all four datasets, even for MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled training examples, and is substantially different from the pre-training tasks" [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 8].

This was unexpected. Conventional wisdom suggested that bigger models would overfit on small datasets. They didn't. Instead, something about scale made models more general, not less.

The authors reflected on this finding: "It has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling... However, we believe that this is the first work to demonstrate convincingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained" [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 8].

The seeds were planted. If scale helped on small tasks, what else might it unlock?

## The Great Scaling Hypothesis

Two years later, OpenAI released a paper that would redefine the field's ambitions. GPT-3 wasn't just bigger—it was audaciously, absurdly bigger. At 175 billion parameters, it dwarfed everything that came before [Brown et al., 2020, p. 9].

The paper presented a hypothesis: maybe intelligence isn't about clever architectures at all. Maybe it emerges naturally from scale. They trained eight different model sizes, from 125 million to 175 billion parameters, and tested them on dozens of tasks. What they found wasn't just quantitative improvement—it was qualitative transformation.

Consider a simple arithmetic task: adding two numbers. GPT-3 Small (125M parameters) got 2% accuracy on two-digit addition. GPT-3 Medium (350M) got 5%. This looks like linear improvement—unremarkable. But watch what happens as you keep scaling.

GPT-3 XL (1.3B parameters): 6% accuracy. Still barely better than random. GPT-3 2.7B: 8%. GPT-3 6.7B: 12%. You might be tempted to extrapolate a smooth curve. You'd be wrong.

GPT-3 13B: 100% accuracy. And GPT-3 175B: also 100% [Brown et al., 2020, p. 22, Figure 3.10].

This isn't a gradual improvement—it's a phase transition. Somewhere between 6.7 billion and 13 billion parameters, the model suddenly "got it." Two-digit subtraction showed the same pattern: 10% at 6.7B, jumping to 98% at 13B and staying at 98% for 175B.

The pattern repeated across tasks. Three-digit addition: 8% at 6.7B, jumping to 80% at 13B and 175B. Four-digit addition: 5% at 6.7B, 25% at both 13B and 175B. It was as if the model crossed some threshold where arithmetic made sense, and beyond that threshold, pure scale mattered less than the crossing itself [Brown et al., 2020, p. 22].

## The Most Surprising Discovery

But arithmetic was just warm-up. The real surprise came from something called few-shot learning—the ability to learn new tasks from just a handful of examples, without any training.

Here's how it works: you show the model a few examples of a task in its context window, then ask it to solve a new instance. No weight updates. No gradient descent. Just pattern matching from examples. It shouldn't work. Traditional machine learning wisdom says you need hundreds or thousands of examples to learn anything meaningful.

Yet it did work. But only at scale.

The paper showed aggregate performance across 42 different benchmarks [Brown et al., 2020, p. 5, Figure 1.3]. For the smallest models, few-shot learning barely helped—sometimes it even hurt performance compared to zero-shot (no examples at all). At 350M parameters, few-shot accuracy was around 25%. At 1.3B, it crept up to 36%. At 2.6B, it reached 39%.

Still nothing revolutionary. But then: 6.7B parameters hit 43%. 13B reached 48%. And GPT-3 175B achieved 58%.

More striking was the gap between zero-shot and few-shot performance at different scales. For small models, providing examples helped a little—maybe 2-3 percentage points. But for GPT-3 175B, the difference between zero-shot (42%) and few-shot (58%) was 16 percentage points. The larger the model, the better it got at learning from examples [Brown et al., 2020, p. 5].

This suggested something profound: the ability to learn from context—to do "meta-learning" on the fly—wasn't something you could train a model to do. It emerged naturally from scale. Small models couldn't do it no matter how hard you tried. Large models did it automatically.

## When Reasoning Emerged

The most dramatic demonstration of emergence came a year later, when researchers at Google discovered chain-of-thought reasoning.

The setup was simple but powerful: instead of asking a model to directly answer a question, you show it examples where the answer is preceded by a step-by-step reasoning process. "Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?" becomes: "Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11" [Wei et al., 2022, p. 4, Figure 3].

This technique—called chain-of-thought prompting—transformed model performance on reasoning tasks. But here's the catch: it only worked for big models.

The paper tested models ranging from 400 million to 540 billion parameters on arithmetic tasks. For small models, chain-of-thought prompting actually hurt performance. LaMDA at 400M parameters achieved 46.4% accuracy on StrategyQA with standard prompting, but only 24.9% with chain-of-thought prompting [Wei et al., 2022, p. 22, Table 4].

The paper described this as an "emergent ability of model scale" [Wei et al., 2022, p. 4]. Emergent, meaning you couldn't predict it from smaller models. The performance curve was flat until suddenly it wasn't.

Consider PaLM on the last letter concatenation task (taking the last letter of each word and combining them—harder than it sounds for a model). At 8B parameters with chain-of-thought: 18.8% accuracy. At 62B: 85.0%. At 540B: 99.4% [Wei et al., 2022, p. 22, Table 5].

The researchers tested whether models could generalize to longer sequences—a form of out-of-distribution generalization that's notoriously hard. Standard prompting failed completely, achieving near 0% on longer sequences regardless of model size. But chain-of-thought prompting on PaLM 540B achieved 94.8% on 3-word concatenation and 63.0% on 4-word concatenation—despite only being shown 2-word examples [Wei et al., 2022, p. 22].

## Why Does Scale Work?

This is the billion-dollar question, and the papers offer glimpses rather than definitive answers.

The BERT paper hypothesized that larger models learn richer representations during pre-training, and these representations transfer better to downstream tasks: "We hypothesize that when the model is fine-tuned directly on the downstream tasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the task-specific models can benefit from the larger, more expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small" [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 9].

The GPT-3 paper went further, suggesting that large models learn more than just patterns—they learn how to learn: "Broadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the few-shot setting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held by fine-tuned models)" [Brown et al., 2020, p. 5].

The chain-of-thought paper dug into this question more deeply through error analysis. They manually examined 45 problems that PaLM 62B answered incorrectly and categorized the errors: semantic understanding (20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors like hallucinations (7 errors). Then they checked how many of these errors were fixed by scaling to 540B [Wei et al., 2022, p. 16, Appendix A.1].

The results: semantic understanding errors decreased from 20 to 14 (6 fixed). One-step-missing errors decreased from 18 to 6 (12 fixed). Other errors decreased from 7 to 3 (4 fixed). Scaling didn't just make the model better at computation—it made it better at understanding and reasoning.

The paper concluded: "The success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated phenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol mapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc)" [Wei et al., 2022, p. 16].

## What Scale Doesn't Fix

But scale isn't magic. The papers documented failures alongside successes, and these failures are revealing.

GPT-3's performance varied wildly across tasks. On some reading comprehension tasks, it achieved near-human performance. On others, particularly natural language inference tasks like ANLI, even the largest model barely exceeded random chance. "All of our models smaller than GPT-3 perform at almost exactly random chance on ANLI, even in the few-shot setting (∼ 33%), whereas GPT-3 itself shows signs of life on Round 3" [Brown et al., 2020, p. 21, Figure 3.9]. "Signs of life" meant 40% accuracy—not much better than the 35% you'd get by guessing.

Chain-of-thought reasoning helped, but remained imperfect. The analysis of LaMDA 137B found that of 50 problems with wrong answers, 46% had chains of thought that were almost correct except for minor errors (calculator mistakes, missing steps), while 54% had major errors in semantic understanding or coherence [Wei et al., 2022, p. 5].

Some abilities seemed to require not just scale but specific architectural choices or training procedures. The papers hint that scale is necessary but not sufficient—a platform on which other improvements can build.

## The Paradigm Shift

What makes these findings profound isn't just that bigger models work better—it's that they work differently. Intelligence, these papers suggest, might not be something you engineer into a system through clever design. It might be something that emerges when you give a simple learning algorithm enough capacity and enough data.

This has philosophical implications. For decades, AI research focused on building the right inductive biases into models—the right architectural structures that would guide learning toward intelligence. Convolutional networks for vision. Recurrent networks for sequences. Attention mechanisms for reasoning.

Scale suggests a different path: maybe general intelligence emerges from general learning mechanisms, given sufficient scale. The architecture matters less than the scale. The training objective matters less than the data. Cleverness matters less than compute.

The GPT-3 paper captured this shift: "We find that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows sufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves. Broadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire further work on language-based approaches to reasoning" [Wei et al., 2022, p. 9].

## The Economics of Intelligence

This paradigm shift has practical consequences. If intelligence scales with compute, then progress becomes a function of resources rather than insights. The field moves from science to engineering, from breakthroughs to buildouts.

GPT-3 required 3,640 petaflop/s-days of compute to train—more than 10 times the compute used for the previous largest model [Brown et al., 2020, p. 9, Figure 2.2]. These aren't the resources of academic labs—they're the resources of tech giants.

The cost-benefit analysis changes too. Training GPT-3 once costs more than training a thousand smaller models. But if that one model can perform hundreds of tasks with few-shot learning, never needing fine-tuning or task-specific training, maybe it's worth it.

The BERT paper noted this tradeoff: "Recent empirical improvements due to transfer learning with language models have demonstrated that rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems. In particular, these results enable even low-resource tasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architectures" [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 9].

## What Comes Next?

The obvious question: will scaling continue to work? The papers document improvements up to 540 billion parameters, but we don't know if the trend continues to a trillion, ten trillion, or beyond.

Some hints suggest it might. The arithmetic results showed that even GPT-3 175B hadn't saturated—it got 25% accuracy on 4-digit addition, suggesting room for improvement [Brown et al., 2020, p. 22]. Chain-of-thought reasoning on PaLM 540B achieved 94% accuracy on some generalization tasks, but not 100%, again suggesting headroom.

But there are concerns too. The scaling laws might break. Compute costs might become prohibitive. Data might run out—GPT-3 already trained on hundreds of billions of tokens, and the internet is only so large [Brown et al., 2020, p. 9, Table 2.2].

More fundamentally, scale might not be enough. The failures on tasks like ANLI suggest that some capabilities require more than just scale—maybe different architectures, different training objectives, or different data distributions.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Perhaps the most unsettling implication of these papers is how little we understand about why any of this works.

We can document that chain-of-thought reasoning emerges at 100B parameters. We can show that few-shot learning improves with scale. We can measure performance improvements as models grow. But we can't really explain why.

The chain-of-thought paper was remarkably honest about this: "The question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted... Future work could more thoroughly investigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally enable such reasoning capabilities" [Wei et al., 2022, p. 16].

This is humbling. We've built systems that can reason, learn from examples, and solve problems. But we don't fully understand how they do it. We know that scale helps, but not why. We know that certain abilities emerge, but not when or under what conditions.

In some sense, we've stumbled onto a powerful empirical finding—that intelligence scales with compute—without a deep theory of why it should. We're running experiments at scales that cost millions of dollars, guided more by intuition than by fundamental understanding.

## Rethinking Intelligence

These papers force us to reconsider what intelligence means. If a 175-billion-parameter model can learn to reason by seeing a few examples, is that fundamentally different from how humans learn? If abilities emerge unpredictably as models scale, is there something about scale itself that's essential to intelligence?

The traditional view held that intelligence requires sophisticated algorithms—the right architecture, the right training procedure, the right inductive biases. These papers suggest something simpler and stranger: maybe intelligence is what happens when you run a simple algorithm at massive scale.

This doesn't diminish intelligence—if anything, it deepens the mystery. How can something as straightforward as predicting the next word, done at sufficient scale, give rise to reasoning, learning, and generalization?

## The Road Ahead

The field now faces a choice. One path continues the scaling paradigm: build bigger models, use more compute, collect more data. See what emerges. This is the path of empirical discovery, of building first and understanding later.

Another path seeks deeper understanding: why does scale work? What are the theoretical foundations? Can we predict which abilities will emerge at which scales? This is the path of science, of theory that guides practice.

Likely, we'll need both. The GPT-3 paper concluded: "Broadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire further work on language-based approaches to reasoning" [Brown et al., 2020, p. 5]. Build bigger models, discover new capabilities, then work backward to understand them.

The BERT paper struck a similar note: "Our major contribution is further generalizing these findings to deep bidirectional architectures, allowing the same pre-trained model to successfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks" [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 9]. Each scaling step opens new possibilities, and each new possibility demands new understanding.

## A New Era

We're living through a paradigm shift in how AI research operates. The old model—small teams, clever ideas, academic publications—still exists, but it's being supplemented by a new model: large teams, massive compute, empirical exploration of what's possible at scale.

The papers in this essay document the transition. BERT showed that scale helps. GPT-3 showed that scale transforms. Chain-of-thought prompting showed that scale unlocks capabilities we didn't know existed.

Each paper pushed the frontier. Each revealed that the frontier had room to push. And each raised more questions than it answered.

The unreasonable effectiveness of scale isn't just about making models bigger. It's about discovering that intelligence—or something very much like it—can emerge from simplicity applied at massive scale. It's about learning that the path to smarter AI might not require smarter algorithms, just more resources applied to the algorithms we already have.

This is both exciting and unsettling. Exciting because it suggests a clear path forward: if intelligence scales with compute, we know how to make progress. Unsettling because it means progress depends more on resources than insights, more on engineering than science.

But most of all, it's humbling. We've built systems that surprise us, that develop capabilities we didn't design, that learn in ways we don't fully understand. Scale has given us power without complete comprehension.

Where this leads, nobody knows. The papers document what happened when we scaled to 100 billion parameters, then 500 billion. The question now is: what happens at a trillion? At ten trillion? At scales we haven't yet imagined?

The only certainty is that scale will continue to surprise us. Just as chain-of-thought reasoning emerged unpredictably at 100B parameters, new capabilities will emerge at future scales. We won't know what they are until we build the models and see what happens.

That's the new game: scaling first, understanding later. Building bigger, then discovering what bigger makes possible. It's not the game we expected to play. But it's the game that intelligence—that strange, emergent property of scale—has revealed.

And we've only just begun.
