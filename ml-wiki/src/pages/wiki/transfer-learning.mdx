## Overview

Transfer learning is the ability to take knowledge learned from one task and apply it to a different but related task, dramatically reducing the amount of task-specific data and training required [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 1].

## The Core Insight

Instead of training a model from scratch for every new task, transfer learning says: "Let's reuse knowledge from a model trained on a large, general task."

In NLP, this typically means:
1. Pretrain on massive amounts of text
2. Fine-tune on your specific task

## Why It's Revolutionary

Transfer learning changed NLP from requiring massive labeled datasets for each task to needing only small amounts of task-specific data. BERT showed you could achieve state-of-the-art results with minimal task-specific architecture [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 2].

## A Real-World Analogy

Learning to drive different vehicles is like transfer learning. Once you learn to drive a car, you can quickly adapt to driving a truck. You transfer core skills (steering, braking) and only need to learn vehicle-specific differences. You don't relearn driving from scratch.

## The Evidence

BERT achieved state-of-the-art on 11 NLP tasks using the same pretrained model with minimal task-specific modifications [Devlin et al., 2018, p. 1]. This demonstrated the power of transfer learning at scale.
