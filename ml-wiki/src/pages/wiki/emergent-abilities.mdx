## Overview

Emergent abilities are capabilities that suddenly appear in language models when they reach sufficient scale, but are absent in smaller models [Wei et al., 2022, p. 3].

## The Scaling Phenomenon

As models grow from millions to billions to hundreds of billions of parameters, new abilities emerge that weren't explicitly trained for:
- Multi-step reasoning
- Following complex instructions
- Solving math word problems
- Performing analogical reasoning

These abilities aren't present in smaller models—they emerge at scale [Wei et al., 2022, p. 3].

## Chain-of-Thought as Emergent

Chain-of-thought reasoning is a prime example of emergence. Models below ~100B parameters show no benefit from chain-of-thought prompting. But at 100B+ parameters, the ability suddenly appears [Wei et al., 2022, p. 3].

## The Mystery of Emergence

Why do these abilities emerge? We don't fully understand, but theories include:
- Models cross a capability threshold
- Sufficient capacity to represent complex patterns
- Combination of simpler skills learned at scale

## A Phase Transition Analogy

Think of water freezing. As temperature drops, nothing happens... until suddenly at 0°C, the entire structure changes from liquid to solid. Emergent abilities work similarly—models gradually improve until suddenly, at a certain scale, a new capability appears.

## Implications

Emergent abilities suggest that:
- Scaling continues to unlock new capabilities
- We can't predict all abilities from small-scale experiments
- There may be more capabilities waiting at even larger scales
