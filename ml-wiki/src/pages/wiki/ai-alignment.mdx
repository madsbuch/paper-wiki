## Overview

AI alignment is the problem of ensuring that AI systems pursue goals and exhibit behaviors that align with human values and intentions [Ouyang et al., 2022, p. 2].

## The Core Challenge

Language models are trained to predict text from the internet. But predicting internet text ≠ being helpful to users. This is a misalignment between the training objective and what we actually want from AI systems [Ouyang et al., 2022, p. 2].

## The InstructGPT Approach

InstructGPT demonstrated one approach to alignment:
1. Define what "aligned" behavior means (helpful, honest, harmless)
2. Collect human feedback on model outputs
3. Use that feedback to train the model to behave as desired

This isn't perfect alignment, but it's practical progress [Ouyang et al., 2022, p. 2].

## The Three H's

InstructGPT aimed for models that are:
- **Helpful**: They solve the user's task effectively
- **Honest**: They don't fabricate information or mislead
- **Harmless**: They don't cause harm to people or society

[Ouyang et al., 2022, p. 2]

## Why It Matters

As AI systems become more capable and deployed more widely, alignment becomes critical. An extremely capable but misaligned AI could:
- Provide harmful advice
- Spread misinformation
- Reinforce biases
- Cause unintended consequences

## The Alignment Tax

Sometimes alignment hurts performance on academic benchmarks—an "alignment tax." But InstructGPT showed this can be minimized while still improving real-world helpfulness [Ouyang et al., 2022, p. 3].

## A Philosophical Challenge

Who decides what "aligned" means? InstructGPT aligned to preferences of their labelers, but broader societal alignment remains an open challenge [Ouyang et al., 2022, p. 19].

## The Path Forward

InstructGPT represents one step toward alignment, but much work remains:
- Scaling oversight as models become more capable
- Aligning with diverse human values
- Preventing specification gaming
- Ensuring robustness
