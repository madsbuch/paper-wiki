## Overview

Reasoning steps are the intermediate computational steps that break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems, making them easier to solve [Wei et al., 2022, p. 2].

## The Decomposition Principle

Complex reasoning requires breaking problems down:

**Without reasoning steps:**
"Roger has 5 balls. He buys 2 cans of 3 balls each. How many now?" → 11

**With reasoning steps:**
- Roger started with 5 balls
- He bought 2 cans
- Each can has 3 balls
- 2 × 3 = 6 balls from cans
- 5 + 6 = 11 total balls

Each step is simpler than the whole problem [Wei et al., 2022, p. 1].

## Why They Matter

Reasoning steps allow language models to:
1. Solve problems they couldn't solve in one step
2. Show their work for interpretability
3. Self-correct by catching errors in intermediate steps
4. Handle longer and more complex reasoning chains

## The Emergence at Scale

Only sufficiently large models (100B+ parameters) can effectively use reasoning steps. Smaller models don't benefit, suggesting reasoning is an emergent ability [Wei et al., 2022, p. 3].

## A Human Analogy

Humans use reasoning steps constantly. When calculating a tip, you don't instantly know the answer—you break it down: "15% of $40... 10% is $4... 5% is $2... so 15% is $6." Language models can now do the same.

## Impact on Performance

Chain-of-thought prompting (which elicits reasoning steps) improved PaLM 540B from 18% to 57% on GSM8K math problems—just by making the model show its reasoning [Wei et al., 2022, p. 2].
