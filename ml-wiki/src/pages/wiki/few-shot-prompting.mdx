## Overview

Few-shot prompting is the technique of including a small number of examples (typically 2-10) in the input prompt to demonstrate the desired task to a language model [Wei et al., 2022, p. 2].

## The Approach

Instead of fine-tuning the model, you simply show it examples in the prompt:

```
Example 1: Input → Output
Example 2: Input → Output
Example 3: Input → Output
Now solve: Your Input → ?
```

The model learns the pattern from the examples and applies it to the new input.

## Why It's Powerful

Few-shot prompting allows task adaptation without:
- Collecting large labeled datasets
- Expensive fine-tuning
- Separate model checkpoints per task

One model can perform many tasks just by changing the prompt [Wei et al., 2022, p. 2].

## Chain-of-Thought Enhancement

Chain-of-thought prompting extends few-shot prompting by including reasoning steps in the examples, dramatically improving performance on reasoning tasks [Wei et al., 2022, p. 1].

## The Scale Factor

Few-shot prompting improves with model scale. Larger models are better at learning from examples in context [Wei et al., 2022, p. 3].

## An Intuitive Story

Few-shot prompting is like showing someone how to solve a math problem by working through a few examples on a whiteboard. They see the pattern and apply it to new problems—no formal training required.
